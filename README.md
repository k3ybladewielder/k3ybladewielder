# About me
Data scientist with +3 years of experience in various sectors such as construction, food/clothing retail, Agro, involving problem solving/projects through forecasting, clustering, classification, NLP, GenAI. Previously, working as a Business Analyst with +6 years of experience. Check out my resume [**here**](https://github.com/k3ybladewielder/k3ybladewielder/blob/main/cv_alysson_ds_researcher.pdf) for a detailed description of the tasks and deliveries performed. 

Currently a Master's student in Computer Science at UFS, I graduated with an MBA in Business Management and Competitive Intelligence from Universidade Tiradentes (2020) and a Bachelor's degree in Administration from Faculdade S√£o Lu√≠s de Fran√ßa (2019).

My research focus is artificial intelligence (AI), specifically **language models**. My work explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to (but not limited to) healthcare, medical and biomedical domains to improve processes, reduce cognitive load on professionals and information overload through methods such as Text Summarization and Named Entity Recognition (NER). In addition, I am interested in Commonsense Reasoning in language models and also Optimization.
